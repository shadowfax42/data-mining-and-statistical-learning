# Data Mining and Statistical Learning (ISYE 7406 - Fall 2022)

This repository contains my personal coursework for **ISYE 7406: Data Mining and Statistical Learning**, a graduate-level course taught by **Dr. Yajun Mei** at Georgia Tech in Fall 2022. The course emphasizes both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of key supervised and unsupervised learning techniques using R.
